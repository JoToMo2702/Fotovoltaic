How to use the Programs.

### IMPORTANT BEFORE USING ANY PROGRAM READ THIS SYMBOL

# You must run the "make" downloaded from https://github.com/ArduCAM/RaspberryPi/tree/master/ArduCAM4Pi
# if there is any problem on the compilation procees you must have:
# sudo apt-get install wiringpi
# sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
# sudo apt-get install libi2c-dev
# sudo apt-get install python-smbus

- To take Pictures from the Arducam you have to run a .c  to do this,
 just go to "/home/pi/DriverS/raspberrypi/ArduCAM4Pi" and ther is it.
Execute in the shell the next command: "sudo ./ov2640_capture -c name.jpg 800x600
You can manipulate the name and resolution (datasheet)

# For this variables you must install python driver for ADS1115 from: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_ADS1x15
# For this variables you must install python driver for SHT31-D from: https://github.com/ralf1070/Adafruit_Python_SHT31

- To take Simple variables like irradiaton, temperature and humidity just run the file
in "/home/pi/DriverS/Variables" TSS.py, and it will write a txt file with all information,
just execute on shell the next command: "python TSS.py"

# To run this algorithm you must have installed OpenCV and Sklearn libraries.

- To make clouds analysis, you go to "/home/pi/DriverS/Clouds" and execute on the shell
this command: python color.py --image /home/pi/DriverS/Clouds/Images/Test/cloud.jpg --clusters 10
We suppose that the images to analyze are in that direction (direction after --image), so
you could put images on that carpet or chage the direction to somewhere else, also you can
change the number of cluster to analyze as you wish, but it has to be a positive number.
The result image will be named "clouds.jpg" on this direction: "/home/pi/DriverS/Clouds/Images/Result"

# To run this program you have to install all thing on the install_estrella tutorial, and
# also compile a .ko file to install the drivers on the pi.

- To use the Spectrometer just connect it, go to "/home/pi/DriverS/Spectrometer/estrella/python_controller"
and run in the shell this command: "python estrella_python_controller.py"
